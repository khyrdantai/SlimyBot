# SlimyBot
A Discord bot that wishes server members a happy birthday. :}

How to use:

1) You will need three text files in the same folder as this program.
   - birthdays.txt
   - channel.txt
   - token.txt

2) For channel.txt, you will need to add the Channel ID from the server channel that you wish the bot to post messages in. 
3) For token.txt, you will need your bot token from the Discord developer portal. DO NOT SHARE YOUR TOKEN!
4) (OPTIONAL) You can manually input the birthdays in the birthdays.txt file
   - Formatting on each line: DDMM.USER_DISCORD_ID

Run "Main.py" in terminal through whatever means you have to run Python. 

Type "!hello" to test if the bot is running. If it replies, it is working. 

To add birthdays, the user must add their birthday by typing "!add DDMM".
